Problem: Making the rules (class) for the Knight
  Solution candidates:
    1. Make a constant array that contains a knight's possible move
      x+2, y+1
      x+2, y-1
      x+1, y+2
      x+1, y-2
      x-2, y+1
      x-2, y-1
      x-1, y+2
      x-1, y-2
      Test:
      [4, 4]
        [6, 5]
        [6, 3]
        [5, 6]
        [5, 2]
        [2, 5]
        [2, 3]
        [3, 6]
        [3, 2]
      Cases to look for:
        x and y cannot exceed below 0 and 7
        The number combinations are always 1 and 2, both can use add or minus or both.

Problem: Assigning coordinates to nodes
  I don't exactly know what to do when building a graph. As Emiel said, the squares and the board are separate from the graph and the nodes. The nodes will contain the coordinates of the squares. The nodes are in the graph. What came up to me recently is that how will I store these nodes that currently do not have a connection? I imagine it looks like a floating nodes in the air waiting for the edges to latch on to. If there are no edges just yet, how would I store them?
  Solution candidates:
    1. Make a list (hash) that stores a node and its coordinates.
      There will be 64 keys which are nodes, each with value starting from [0][0] to [7][7]
        (I think nodes being values and coordinates being keys are better)
      A directed graph will be initialized at the starting point of the knight.
      Find all the moves possible, store in arrays, find which array has the shortest length (more pseudocode for this later)

      If keys and values are nodes and coordinates respectively:
        When #knight_moves is called with the starting coord,
        we can find which node has that value.
        That will be the starting point of the graph.
        In my not-yet-thought-out algorithm in finding the shortest path,
        I assume that it has to find all paths of the knight without going back.
        It will store all the paths, and we can recursively search or find the shortest path.
        However I think such algorithm will take so long, which leads me to another question:
          If there is a way to find the shortest path

        To start with this, create a Graph class containing four basic methods
          #add_node - which will simply add nodes to a hash. Perhaps name it squareN where N is the number of node. Its value will be an empty Set
          #add_connection - which will search for the origin and insert the destination in the set in case it doesnt exist(?). Else simply insert the destination in the origin
          #build_graph - so that everything is already set:
            Instantiate a board
          
          I think these methods should be just for conveniency when the knight reaches its destination, so  that we can reuse the graph with new connections.
          #remove_node
          #remove_connection
          Then, create a Node class containing two properties:
            its data (coords)
            reference to the node it's connected to


Problem: Algorithm for knight's shortest path
Solution candidate:
  So there's a constant of values declared that a knight move can do.
  Idea is since there are 8 moves, say we start from [0, 1],
  then use the first move possible. That's the first path.
  Then use the second move possible, there goes the second path. 
  So on until there's no more move possible. (Keeping in mind of two cases: exceeding 00 & 77 and it has been visited)
  When a particular path reaches the destination, entire process stops.
  Get that path and print out each steps from origin to destination.

  Level 2 pseudocode (i just made this up):
    Make a constant array of knight_options
      KNIGHT_OPTIONS = [
        [2, 1],
        [2, -1],
        [1, 2],
        [1, -2],
        [-2, 1],
        [-2, -1],
        [-1, 2],
        [-1, -2]
      ]
    Make the #knight_moves(origin, destination)
      def knight_moves(origin, destination)
        origin = find_node_by_data(origin)
        prev_move = origin
        queue = []
        queue.push(origin)
        until destination is found
          next_move = KNIGHT_OPTIONS.each do |move|
            front_node = queue.shift  
            # get the next coordinates to find the next possible move
            next_x = (front_node[0] + move[0])
            next_y = (front_node[1] + move[1])
            next_coord = [next_x, next_y]
            push move in queue unless move is greater than [7, 7] or less than [0, 0]
            call #add_connection
              - might want to remove the first 2 lines because unnecessary
              - set destination's @prev to prev_move
            end
          end
        take the destination and take its previous nodes
        print them
      end
      
Another thing to consider: Just realized, why is the function example is [0, 1], not [0][1]? How else would call the position that way or is it just a simple representation?
